# Unreleased

- Updated dependencies
- Always handle errors gracefully (removed `PropagateExceptions`)
- Added `EnableUnderscoreToColonMapping` option, which maps keys like `ConnectionStrings__DB` to
  `ConnectionStrings:DB` (both keys are available, and yield the same secret); fixes #7

# 1.0.6

- You can now set a `PropagateExceptions` boolean to specify whether errors while loading the secrets should be
  propagated or suppressed
- Added exponential backoff for failed requests (max 10 failed requests; the `LoadTimeout` has precedence)
- Updated to the latest Infisical SDK

# 1.0.5

- Package now includes source link to GitHub sources

# 1.0.4

# 1.0.1
